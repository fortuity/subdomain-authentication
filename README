Subdomain-Authentication
========================

You can use this project as a starting point for any Rails web application that requires subdomains and authentication. User management and authentication is implemented using the Devise gem (http://github.com/plataformatec/devise). The subdomain_routes gem (http://github.com/mholling/subdomain_routes/)  implements subdomains and routing.
